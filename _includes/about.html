            I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at the
            <a href="https://di.uoa.gr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              National and Kapodistrian University of Athens
            </a>, specializing in software systems and secure development.
            I’ve worked on academic team projects involving C, Python, Java, and web technologies like React and TailwindCSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about full-stack development, cybersecurity, and systems programming. Through my studies, I’ve gained hands-on
            experience with secure coding practices, version control (Git), and addressing common vulnerabilities such as XSS and SQL Injection.
